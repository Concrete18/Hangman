# Hangman

This repository was created to make a prototype version of Hangman in Python so I could use it as a way to learn Rust.

```
    |-------|
    |       |
    |       O
    |      /|\
    |      / \
    |_______________
```

I have completed the Both versions but I focused on the Rust version. It does everything that the Python one does but faster and without any known errors.
